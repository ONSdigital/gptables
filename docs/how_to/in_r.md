## R Usage

Use of `gptables` in R requires use of python via the [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) package.

However we recommend use of the [aftables](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact/aftables)
R package, maintained by the Presentation Champions Data Visualisation Tools subgroup.
