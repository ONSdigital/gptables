# Closed Issue Log

This log documents feature requests that we do not currently intend to implement in gptables.
This is due to the request being non-compliant with Analysis Function [spreadsheet accessibility guidance][guidance].
These issues may be re-opened in future if guidance changes - please contribute to the discussion by heading to
the GitHub issue.
